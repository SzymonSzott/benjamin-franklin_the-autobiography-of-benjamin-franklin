style. This change in the calendar was made in 1582 by Pope Gregory
XIII, and adopted in England in 1752. Every year whose number in
the common reckoning since Christ is not divisible by 4, as well as
every year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by 400, shall
have 365 days, and all other years shall have 366 days. In the
eighteenth century there was a difference of eleven days between
the old and the new style of reckoning, which the English
Parliament canceled by making the 3rd of September, 1752, the 14th.
The Julian calendar, or "old style," is still retained in Russia
and Greece, whose dates consequently are now 13 days behind those
of other Christian countries.</p>

the first issue. Following is the order in which the other four
papers were published: <i>Boston News Letter</i>, 1704; <i>Boston

McMaster tells us that when Franklin was American Agent in France,

be no question that Franklin's moral improvement and happiness were
due to the practice of these virtues, yet most people will agree
that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive
to a virtuous life. Franklin's own suggestion that the scheme
smacks of "foppery in morals" seems justified. Woodrow Wilson well
puts it: "Men do not take fire from such thoughts, unless something
deeper, which is missing here, shine through them. What may have
seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us
nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense
and sound conduct. What redeems it from pettiness in this book is
the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in Franklin
himself, who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor
for his own life." See <i>Galatians</i>, chapter V, for the
Christian plan of moral perfection.</p>

of Franklin, the most eminently practical man of his age, in favor
of reserving the study of the dead languages until the mind has
reached a certain maturity, is confirmed by the confession of one
of the most eminent scholars of any age.</p>

<p>"'Our seminaries of learning,' says Gibbon, 'do not exactly
correspond with the precept of a Spartan king, that the child
should be instructed in the arts which will be useful to the man;
since a finished scholar may emerge from the head of Westminster or
Eton, in total ignorance of the business and conversation of
English gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century. But
these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they
pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek
languages.'"&mdash;Bigelow.</p>

American views on the relations between the mother country and her
colonies. Grenville here made clear that the Americans were to have
no voice in making or amending their laws. Parliament and the king
were to have absolute power over the colonies. No wonder Franklin
was alarmed by this new doctrine.</p>
